Thanks to funding from Jardiniers du Nous and Chemins de la Transition, we were able to carry out an initial POC to generate Open Badges with ActivityPods.

![OpenBadges.app](/assets/activitypods-app.png)

This POC enables us to generate Open Badges and then issue them to our contacts via the ActivityPub protocol. Badges can also be exported or imported from other solutions such as Open Badges Factory.

The application was not deployed, but its source code can be seen on [this Github repository](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/openbadges.app).

For two days, we met in Normandy to talk about the results and the future of this project.
