Thanks to funding from the associations [Jardiniers du Nous](https://www.jardiniersdunous.org) and [Les Chemins de la Transition](https://lescheminsdelatransition.org), we were able to carry out an initial POC ("Proof of concept") to generate Open Badges with [ActivityPods](https://activitypods.org).

This POC enables us to generate Open Badges and then issue them to our contacts via the ActivityPub protocol. Badges can also be exported or imported from other Open Badges solutions such as Open Badges Factory.

The application was not deployed, but its source code can be seen on [this Github repository](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/openbadges.app).

For two days, we met in Normandy to talk about the results of this first experiment and the future of the ActivityBadges project.
