For the second time, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) is offering an open call to finance projects aimed at increasing the resilience of territories (https://wiki.resilience-territoire.ademe.fr).

The associations [Jardiniers du Nous](https://www.jardiniersdunous.org) and [Les Chemins de la Transition](https://lescheminsdelatransition.org) have responded to this call by proposing [Badgeons la Transition](<(https://wiki.resilience-territoire.ademe.fr/wiki/Badgeons_la_transition)>). This project, which aims to equip Transition actors with open badges, will be based on the ActivityBadges specification and ActivityPods technology.

Both associations were particularly interested in the possibilities offered by ActivityBadges for peer-to-peer exchanges, without the need for a central authority to issue badges.

A response is expected this summer.
