description: For the second time, ADEME is offering a open call for proposals to fund projects that increase territorial resilience
---

For the second time, ADEME is offering a open call for proposals to fund projects that increase territorial resilience (https://wiki.resilience-territoire.ademe.fr).

The association Les Jardiniers du Nous has responded to this call by proposing the "Badgeons la Transition" project, which can be seen on [this page](https://wiki.resilience-territoire.ademe.fr/wiki/Badgeons_la_transition). The technical solution proposed is ActivityBadges.

A response is expected this summer.
