After more than a year's work, we're delighted to announce the release of ActivityPods 2.0, the framework on which we built the [first POC of the ActivityBadges project](first-poc-with-activitypods).

With ActivityPods 2.0, each application is completely independent of the Pod provider. We are now offering a framework not only for the frontend, but also for the backend. It will now be possible to create and manage open badges from this backend.

For more information on this new version, see [this blog post](https://activitypods.org/activitypods-2-0-is-out).

A hackathon may be held in Caen (Normandy) in early 2025, during which developers will be able to work together to release a new version of the OpenBadges application. [Contact us](mailto:contact@activitybadges.org) if you'd like to be kept in the loop!
