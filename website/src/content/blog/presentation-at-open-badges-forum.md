The Open Badges Forum was held at the Dôme in Caen on 29 and 30 June 2023.

We had the chance to co-host a technical workshop with Serge Ravet, president of the Reconnaître association.

After discussing the current limitations of Open Badges, we presented the ActivityBadges specification. Serge then presented [ORCA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reconnaitre_openrecognition-openbadges-plateformes-activity-7072553379557724160-dPoj), another technical solution that attempts to address the same issues in a different way.

The ActivityBadges proposal generated a lot of interest from participants, and we hope to be able to present concrete advances at a future event.
