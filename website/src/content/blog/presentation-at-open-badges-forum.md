The Open Badges forum was held at the Dôme in Caen on 29 and 30 June 2023.

We co-hosted a technical workshop with Serge Ravet, President of the Reconnaître association.

After discussing the current problems and limitations of Open Badges, we presented the ActivityBadges specification. Serge then presented ORCA, another technical solution that attempts to address the same issues in a different way.
